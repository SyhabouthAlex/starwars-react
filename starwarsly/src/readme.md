Explorative Star Wars app that starts from the first Star Wars film and populates the site by users clicking on associated items 
within the films, planets, and characters they discover. Uses react-redux to manage state, redux-persist to persist the store even
when the app is offline, redux-thunk to support asynchronous API calls within reducers, and react-router-dom to support routing.
